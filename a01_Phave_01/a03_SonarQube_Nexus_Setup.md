# SetUp SonarQube

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update package manager repositories
sudo apt-get update

# Install necessary dependencies
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl

# Create directory for Docker GPG key
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings

# Download Docker's GPG key
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Ensure proper permissions for the key
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add Docker repository to Apt sources
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \

Save this script in a file, for example, `install_docker.sh`, and make it executable using:

```bash
chmod +x install_docker.sh
```

Then, you can run the script using:

```bash
./install_docker.sh
```

## Create Sonarqube Docker container
To run SonarQube in a Docker container with the provided command, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name sonar -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:lts-community
```

This command will download the `sonarqube:lts-community` Docker image from Docker Hub if it's not already available locally. Then, it will create a container named "sonar" from this image, running it in detached mode (`-d` flag) and mapping port 9000 on the host machine to port 9000 in the container (`-p 9000:9000` flag).

3. Access SonarQube by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://VmIP:9000`.

This will start the SonarQube server, and you should be able to access it using the provided URL. 
If you're running Docker on a remote server or a different port, replace `localhost` with the appropriate hostname or IP address and adjust the port accordingly.
Default name: admin
Default password: admin


## Create Nexus using docker container

To create a Docker container running Nexus 3 and exposing it on port 8081, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name nexus -p 8081:8081 sonatype/nexus3:latest
```

This command does the following:

- `-d`: Detaches the container and runs it in the background.
- `--name nexus`: Specifies the name of the container as "nexus".
- `-p 8081:8081`: Maps port 8081 on the host to port 8081 on the container, allowing access to Nexus through port 8081.
- `sonatype/nexus3:latest`: Specifies the Docker image to use for the container, in this case, the latest version of Nexus 3 from the Sonatype repository.

After running this command, Nexus will be accessible on your host machine at http://IP:8081.

## Get Nexus initial password
Your provided commands are correct for accessing the Nexus password stored in the container. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Get Container ID**: You need to find out the ID of the Nexus container. You can do this by running:

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

    This command lists all running containers along with their IDs, among other information.

2. **Access Container's Bash Shell**: Once you have the container ID, you can execute the `docker exec` command to access the container's bash shell:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it <container_ID> /bin/bash
    ```

    Replace `<container_ID>` with the actual ID of the Nexus container.

3. **Navigate to Nexus Directory**: Inside the container's bash shell, navigate to the directory where Nexus stores its configuration:

    ```bash
    cd sonatype-work/nexus3
    ```

4. **View Admin Password**: Finally, you can view the admin password by displaying the contents of the `admin.password` file:

    ```bash
    cat admin.password
    ```

5. **Exit the Container Shell**: Once you have retrieved the password, you can exit the container's bash shell:

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

This process allows you to access the Nexus admin password stored within the container. Make sure to keep this password secure, as it grants administrative access to your Nexus instance.
